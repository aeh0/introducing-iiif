    <title>What is IIIF?</title>

<body>
    <p>In the last section, we looked at opening a IIIF object in Universal Viewer. UV is one of several IIIF viewers. Each viewer has slightly different benefits and functionality for the user, and its worth trying a few to see which you prefer. For more information about the different available viewers, and how to use them, see the IIIF website.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why you need to use a IIIF viewer, when it's simple enough to copy a link from the address bar and share it.</p>
<p>The difference lies in context. IIIF viewers fetch all images in an object from the links provided in the manifest, and uses the packaged code to organise them in the correct order. The viewer also unpacks any metadata included in manifest. In that way, a link is always maintained between a single image, and its wider meaning. An image will never be orphaned from its original context, or from its holding repository.</p>

<p>IIIF also allows users to share a particular section of a particular page. In a scholarly or heritage context, there are any number of reasons why someone might want to share a small section of a digital object - an image in a book, a note in a margin, damage on a painting.</p>
<p>IIIF allows a link to be generated and shared, that will take the recpient directly to a precise location of a digital object. This might support collaborative research, academic citation, exhibition planning, or debating potential conservation treatments.</p>  

<p>Sharing via IIIF has a huge advantage over sending someone an isolated screenshot of a detail. The recipient of a link to a IIIF image is able to see the detail in the context of the wider object, and also see the full bibliographic details, including the location of the original.</p> 
<h3>Exercise: Sharing a link to Universal Viewer</h3>
<h3>Exercise: Sharing a link to Mirador</h3>
<p>Mirador is an alternative IIIF viewer. One of its features is being able to open up multiple manifests, from digital objects all over the world, and allowing them to be saved in a particular state. For example, a researcher might have loaded four or five books to Mirador, opened each to a particular page, and zoomed each page to a particular detail. Mirador allows that researcher to come back to their workspace at a later date, or share it with others to work collaboratively. 
These objects, loaded to Mirador are not just a collection of images. They're more like a map, that traces paths from those images to their objects and to the repositories in which they were found. If the workspace were shared, the recipient could go to the top right image, for example, and scroll through the rest of the pages, or click a link that would take them to that library's catalogue to see what else they have. IIIF images don’t exist in isolation.</p>

            <p><b>REUNITED.</b> IIIF is designed with interoperability in mind. The images of any institution using the framework will work in the same way as those of another. This means that code from multiple digital objects can be stitched together to create a new digital composite, digitally reuniting and reconstructing cultural heritage that may have become physically separated across different repositories. <a href="https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This demo</a> shows the virtual reconstruction of a damaged manuscript from Châteauroux in France (Grandes Chroniques de France, ca. 1460). At some point in the manuscript's history, its fourteen illuminations were cut out, and by the 19th century, had ended up at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The digitisation of the <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&maximumRecords=50&page=1&query=(dc.source%20all%20%224-AD-133%22)%20and%20(dc.type%20all%20%22image%22)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniatures</a> by BNF, and the <a href="https://arca.irht.cnrs.fr/ark:/63955/md53ws85cj4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full manuscript</a> by Chateauroux Municipal Library, allows the virtual reconstruction of the manuscript in its original state, using IIIF. In a single interface, the viewer can examine either Châteauroux's damaged manuscript, BNF's images, or both objects reunited.</p>

            <p><b>ENHANCED.</b> In the example above, two digital layers can be toggled on or off, and their opacity adjusted, within the browser. This is purely for the benefit of the viewer - no changes are made to the original image. Similarly, <a href="https://archive.org/details/arg160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a> features a tool to enhance images in-browser: adjusting brightness, contrast and polarity to improve accessibility and readability. Follow the link, and click on the ellipses on the left to access a visual adjustments menu. Altering these settings has various useful applications for bringing out details that might be hard to see in the original. It can be particularly valuable when trying to read faint handwriting on a manuscript, or decipher information that has been crossed out, representing a significant enhancement of the original document.</p>

            <p><b>EXAMINED.</b> IIIF images can be zoomed into at astonishing levels of detail, quickly and responsively, even when the image is very large. This is because they're digitally segmented, or tiled like a mosaic, before being served to a web browser. When a browser loads a tiled image, it doesn’t render every tile – just enough pixels to make the image legible at its current size. When a viewer starts to zoom in on a section of the image, more tiles are loaded - but only for that section - and this reduces the processing power needed to view the image in detail. Take a look at <a href="https://hyper-resolution.org/view.html?pointer=0.329,0.001&i=Rijksmuseum/SK-C-5/SK-C-5_VIS_20-um_2019-12-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Night Watch</a>, from the Rijksmuseum, the largest and most detailed photo ever taken of a work of art. Strictly speaking, this is not a single digital image, but a composite of thousands of smaller images, as the original painting was photographed in high resolution 8,439 times. This creates a composite image of 5.6TB - without IIIF tiling, attempting to open a file that large would crash most browsers.</p>
