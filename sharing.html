    <h2>Sharing and comparing digital objects from different institutions in a single workspace</h2>
    <p>In the last section, we looked at opening a IIIF object in Universal Viewer. UV is one of several IIIF viewers. Each viewer has slightly different benefits and functionality for the user, and its worth trying a few to see which you prefer. For more information about the different available viewers, and how to use them, see the IIIF website.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why you need to use a IIIF viewer, when it's simple enough to copy a link from the address bar and share it.</p>
<p>The difference lies in context. IIIF viewers fetch all images in an object from the links provided in the manifest, and uses the packaged code to organise them in the correct order. The viewer also unpacks any metadata included in manifest. In that way, a link is always maintained between a single image, and its wider meaning. An image will never be orphaned from its original context, or from its holding repository.</p>

<p>IIIF also allows users to share a particular section of a particular page. In a scholarly or heritage context, there are any number of reasons why someone might want to share a small section of a digital object - an image in a book, a note in a margin, damage on a painting.</p>
<p>IIIF allows a link to be generated and shared, that will take the recpient directly to a precise location of a digital object. This might support collaborative research, academic citation, exhibition planning, or debating potential conservation treatments.</p>  

<p>Sharing via IIIF has a huge advantage over sending someone an isolated screenshot of a detail. The recipient of a link to a IIIF image is able to see the detail in the context of the wider object, and also see the full bibliographic details, including the location of the original.</p> 
<h3>Exercise: Sharing a link to Universal Viewer</h3>
<h3>Exercise: Sharing a link to Mirador</h3>
<p>Mirador is an alternative IIIF viewer. One of its features is being able to open up multiple manifests, from digital objects all over the world, and allowing them to be saved in a particular state. For example, a researcher might have loaded four or five books to Mirador, opened each to a particular page, and zoomed each page to a particular detail. Mirador allows that researcher to come back to their workspace at a later date, or share it with others to work collaboratively. 
These objects, loaded to Mirador are not just a collection of images. They're more like a map, that traces paths from those images to their objects and to the repositories in which they were found. If the workspace were shared, the recipient could go to the top right image, for example, and scroll through the rest of the pages, or click a link that would take them to that library's catalogue to see what else they have. IIIF images donâ€™t exist in isolation.</p>
