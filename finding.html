  <h2>Access the world's highest quality, re-usable images of cultural heritage</h2>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIIF website</a>. The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. The number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF is estimated at 1 billion.</p>
<p>The manifest is a package that contains:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>links to all the images belonging to a digital object</li>
  <li>structural metadata - how to organise and present the images</li>
  <li>descriptive metadata - title, author, date, location of the physical object</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The manifest looks like a URL, but when pasted to the address bar in a browser, you'll only see code, written in json. It needs to be pasted into a IIIF viewer or tool in order for the object to render.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Finding and opening a IIIF manifest</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of institutions that support IIIF</a> on the IIIF website. Choose an institution's collections to explore - clicking on their name will lead you to a page that provides a link to their digital collections platform, and a screenshot showing where to find the manifest.</li>
<li>Follow the link to your chosen institution's digital collections platform, and run a search.</li>
<li>Choose a result, and use the screenshot on the IIIF website to help locate the manifest/link. It's often attached to the IIIF logo. Right click to copy the manifest link.</li>
<li>Some institutions' digital collections are easier to navigate than others! If you get stuck, try choosing from this pre-selected list of interesting items.</li>
<li>When you've copied a manifest, go to <a href="https://universalviewer.io">Universal Viewer</a>, and scroll down the page to find a box where you can paste your manifest link. Click 'View' - your digital object should open, and allow you to zoom in, pan around, and examine the item in detail.</li>
</ul>
