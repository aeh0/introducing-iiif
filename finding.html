<h2>Access the world's highest quality, re-usable images of cultural heritage</h2>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/">IIIF website</a>. The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. In 2022, the number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF was estimated at 1 billion.</p>
<p>Clicking on the link to each institution will lead you to a page that describes how to access that institution's digital collections, and how to find the manifest for a IIIF object.</p>
<p>The manifest is a package that contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>links to all the images belonging to a digital object</li>
  <li>structural metadata - how to organise and present the images</li>
  <li>descriptive metadata - title, author, date, location of the physical object</li>
</ul>  
<p>The manifest is written in json, but looks like a web address. When pasted to the address bar in a browser, you can only see the code. But when pasted to a IIIF viewer or tool, the object will render.</p>
