  <h2>Access the world's highest quality, re-usable images of cultural heritage</h2>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIIF website</a>. The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. The number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF is estimated at 1 billion.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Finding and opening a IIIF object in Universal Viewer</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of institutions that support IIIF</a> on the IIIF website. Choose an institution's collections to explore - clicking on their name will lead you to a page that provides a link to their digital collections platform, and a screenshot showing where to find the manifest. 
<p>Manifests are the key to unlocking IIIF items for re-use. They look like this:</p>  
<ul>
  <li>example</li>
  <li>example</li>
  <li>example</li>
</ul>
<p>Manifests looks a bit like links, but they're more like parcels. Rather than pushing a user to the location of a digital object on the web, a manifest packages everything a computer needs to know in order for that user to pull the digital object into their own location. The package contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>links to all the images belonging to a digital object</li>
    <li>structural metadata - instructions on how to organise and present the images</li>
    <li>descriptive metadata - the title, author, date, location of the physical object</li>
  </ul>
<p>A manifest stores this information as json code - if you paste a manifest into a browser's address bar, you can see it - but don't worry, you don't need to understand it! All you need to do is copy the manifest itself, and paste it into a IIIF viewer or tool in order for the object to render.</p>
  
<p>Every institution's digital collections platform presents information about its objects, manifests slightly differently, and some are easier to find than others. Some example screenshots:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Follow the link to your chosen institution's digital collections platform, and run a search.</p>
<p>Choose a result, and use the screenshot on the IIIF website to help locate the manifest. It's often attached to the IIIF logo. Right click to copy the manifest link.</p>
<p>Some institutions' digital collections are easier to navigate than others! If you get stuck, copy one of the example manifests above.</p>
<p>When you've copied a manifest, go to <a href="https://universalviewer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Viewer</a>, and scroll down the page to find a box where you can paste your manifest link. Click 'View' - your digital object should open, and allow you to zoom in, pan around, and examine the item in detail.</p>
