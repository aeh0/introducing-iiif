<h2>Access the world's highest quality, re-usable images of cultural heritage</h2>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIIF website</a>. The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. The number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF is estimated at 1 billion.</p>
<p>The manifest is a package that contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>links to all the images belonging to a digital object</li>
  <li>structural metadata - how to organise and present the images</li>
  <li>descriptive metadata - title, author, date, location of the physical object</li>
</ul>  
<p>The manifest looks like a URL, but when pasted to the address bar in a browser, you'll only see code, written in json. It needs to be pasted into a IIIF viewer or tool in order for the object to render.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Finding and opening a IIIF manifest</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of institutions that support IIIF</a> on the IIIF website. Choose an institution's collections to explore - clicking on their name will lead you to a page that provides a link to their digital collections platform, and a screenshot showing where to find the manifest.</p>
<p>Follow the link to your chosen institution's digital collections platform, and run a search.</p>
<p>Choose a result, and use the screenshot on the IIIF website to help locate the manifest/link. It's often attached to the IIIF logo. Right click to copy the manifest link.</p>
<p>Go to Universal Viewer, and scroll down the page to find a box where you can paste your manifest link. Your digital object should open, and allow you to zoom in, pan around, and examine the item in detail.</p>
