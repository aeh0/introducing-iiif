  <h2>Access the world's highest quality, re-usable images of cultural heritage</h2>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions that deliver freely licensed access to their digital collections using IIIF are listed on the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIIF website</a>. The list includes major museums and galleries, state and national libraries, and research-led universities from around the world. The number of cultural heritage items made available via IIIF is estimated at 1 billion.</p>
<p>The manifest is a package that contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>links to all the images belonging to a digital object</li>
  <li>structural metadata - how to organise and present the images</li>
  <li>descriptive metadata - title, author, date, location of the physical object</li>
</ul>
<p>The manifest looks like a URL, but when pasted to the address bar in a browser, you'll only see code, written in json. It needs to be pasted into a IIIF viewer or tool in order for the object to render.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Finding and opening a IIIF manifest</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of institutions that support IIIF</a> on the IIIF website. Choose an institution's collections to explore - clicking on their name will lead you to a page that provides a link to their digital collections platform, and a screenshot showing where to find the manifest. Every digital collection presents manifests slightly differently, and some are easier to find than others. Some example screenshots:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Follow the link to your chosen institution's digital collections platform, and run a search.

Choose a result, and use the screenshot on the IIIF website to help locate the manifest/link. It's often attached to the IIIF logo. Right click to copy the manifest link.

Some institutions' digital collections are easier to navigate than others! If you get stuck, try choosing from this pre-selected list of interesting items.

When you've copied a manifest, go to <a href="https://universalviewer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Viewer</a>, and scroll down the page to find a box where you can paste your manifest link. Click 'View' - your digital object should open, and allow you to zoom in, pan around, and examine the item in detail.</p>
