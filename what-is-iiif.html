<h3>A global standard for viewing and sharing quality images of cultural heritage</h3>
<p>One of the biggest issues faced by those who use digital representations of books, archives, or art in research or teaching, is that almost every library or museum presents their digitised material inconsistently. Different institutions use different digital viewers, varying in functionality and ease of use, and implement different rules about download and re-use. It's a confusing landscape to navigate.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework</a>, pronounced 'triple-eye-eff', aims to bring order to digital chaos. Essentially, it's a list of rules that institutions agree to adhere to. These rules determine a set way to present images and their descriptive data, ensuring that digital images can be viewed and shared online in a consistent and interoperable way, regardless of origin. Institutions that follow these rules are helping to break down digital silos, and unlock their collections for global re-use. To date, IIIF has been formally adopted by <a href="https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/">over 100 major cultural heritage organisations</a> worldwide.</p> 
<p>IIIF offers a number of benefits. Images from libraries, archives, galleries, and museums that have adopted the framework can be:</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Reunited.</b> IIIF is designed with interoperability in mind. The images of any institution using the framework will work in the same way as those of another. This means that code from multiple digital objects can be stitched together to create a new digital composite, digitally reuniting and reconstructing cultural heritage that may have become physically separated across different repositories. <a href="https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/demo/">This demo</a> shows the virtual reconstruction of a damaged manuscript from Châteauroux in France (Grandes Chroniques de France, ca. 1460). At some point in the manuscript's history, its fourteen illuminations were cut out, and by the 19th century, eventually ended up at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The digitisation of the miniatures by BNF, and the full manuscript by Chateauroux Municipal Library, allows the virtual reconstruction of the manuscript in its original state, using IIIF. The viewer can choose to examine the mutilated manuscript, the removed images, or see both objects reunited.</li>
<li><b>Enhance.</b> In the example above, two digital layers can be toggled on or off, and the opacity adjusted, within the browser. This is purely for the benefit of the viewer, and makes no changes to the original image. Similarly, <a href="https://archive.org/details/arg160">The Internet Archive</a> features a tool to enhance images in-browser: adjusting brightness, contrast and polarity to improve accessibility. Follow the link, and click on the ellipses on the left to access a visual adjustments menu.</li>
<li><a href="#compare">compared​ side by side in one browser window</li></a>
<li>​<a href="#examine">examined in minute, magnified detail</li></a>
<li><a href="#annotate">annotated​ with text or other images to provide scholarly commentary</li></a>
</ul>
